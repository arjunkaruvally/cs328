# Basic Introduction to Python

This is a small notebook that contains material that introduces concepts in python that will be useful for the course CS328. For more detailed introduction you can go to one of the following resources or it is freely available in the internet.

- [http://introtopython.org/](http://introtopython.org/) - This has a nice beginner python things with jupyter notebooks.
- [https://www.w3schools.com/python/] - This has much more detailed reference into Python with many extra knowledge and advanced concepts

## Setting up environment

For this course you will need python 3. It is advised to install jupyter with the anaconda environment. Anaconda provides most of the tools that is needed for the course in one package. Alternatively you can install the packages separately using pip or any package manager. Additionally you would need matplotlib, numpy and scipy for the first part of the first assignment. Using conda most of numpy and scipy will be available by default. If it is not available use the following links.

- [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - If using conda, you can install python3 using conda. Otherwise `pip` is another option
- [https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) - Conda guide with instructions for installation.
- [https://jupyter.org/install](https://jupyter.org/install) - Jupyter notebook guide with installation instructions.
- [https://www.scipy.org/](https://www.scipy.org/) - Scipy guide
- [https://numpy.org/](https://numpy.org/) - numpy usually comes with scipy, incase it does not use this guide
- [https://matplotlib.org/](https://matplotlib.org/) - Plotting library we will be using

At the very least, you should be able to run the `Intro_to_Python.ipynb` notebook. If all the configuration is done you will be able to download and work on Assignment 1
